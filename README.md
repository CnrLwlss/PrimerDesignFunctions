# PrimerDesignFunctions

DesignPrimers.py uses yeastmine to obtain genomic DNA sequences used in primer design. Primer sequences are automatically generated, printed and saved to a text file. Primers can be designed for a number of applications:


•	Amplification of DNA (ORF, flanking regions or promoter regions)

•	Gene deletion

•	Incorporation of a protein TAG


Primers will be generated for those genes listed in input.txt
